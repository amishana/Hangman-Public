# Hangman-Public
### Description:<br />
This game follows the rules of the traditional game of "Hangman" except it is a one-player version. Once the game is started you will be asked how many letters the word should be. Then, you will be asked how many lives you would like to play with. After that, guess an individual letter each time you are prompted, with the aim of guessing the full word correctly. Once you either correctly guess the word or lose all your lives, the game will end and the computer will ask if you would like to play again. The computer will prompt you with each of these actions. When asked for a number or letter, if you input a different character than expected, the computer will continue asking until the correct type of character is inputted. 

### How to Gain Access to the Full Repository:<br />
I submitted this project as a part of a class at UC Santa Cruz, and am not allowed to post it publicly. If you would like to see this project, please message me on LinkedIn (at www.linkedin.com/in/amishanambiar) and I will grant you access. Thank you for your understanding.

### How to Run This Project:<br />
First, install a Python IDE. I used PyCharm for this project, but others such as IDLE or Visual Studio should work as well. Then, download all the files in the repository and open them in your IDE. Run hangman.py to play the game or hangman_test.py to play the game with a shortened dictionary for testing purposes.

### Authors:<br />
#### Amisha Nambiar and Professor Larissa Munishkina from the University of California Santa Cruz
Amisha Nambiar authored hangman.py and hangman_test.py.<br />
Amisha Nambiar and Professor Larissa Munishkina authored the pseudocode for hangman.py and hangman_test.py.<br />
Professor Larissa Munishkina provided dictionary.txt and dictionary-short.txt.<br />

### Files in This Repository:<br />
dictionary.txt contains all the possible words for the computer to choose from.<br />
dictionary-short.txt contains one word of each possible word length for the computer to choose from.<br />
hangman.py contains the code for the game using dictionary.txt as the inputted dictionary file.<br />
hangman_test.py contains the same code as hangman.py except the inputted dictionary file is dictionary-short.txt. This will allow the user to test if the game mechanics are working correctly using a known word.
